            <p class = "post-meta">Review written 24/06/2025.</p>
            <b>10/10</b>
            <p>Writing a review for <em>Loveless</em> is a bit of an exercise in futility. What really is there to say about this record that hasn't already been said? The layers of sonic bliss that make up the content of this album have been endlessly dissected by every reviewer under the sun, and even the act of starting a review of it by acknowledging how unoriginal you sound is probably cliched enough at this point.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Yet, here I am, on what must be at least the 100th time I've listened to this record in full (and that's a very, very conservative estimate), and I feel like I'm doing the album itself a disservice if I don't mindlessly gush about how it's essentially changed my understanding of what music can be.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Shoegaze was a genre that I had a bit of a rough time getting into. I was first exposed to <em>Loveless</em> whilst unsuspectingly checking out the RYM top all time album chart. It wasn't a record I was familiar with, and having listened to the majority of the top 10 already I figured I'd give it a go in a free study period at school. As soon as the introducing spatter of Only Shallow's drums gave way to that sea of guitar lines, I was immediately disoriented, confused, curious - essentially every possible reaction you could have to an album was going through my head at that singular moment. The more I listened, I felt like I was growing frustrated with the album. This sea of droning noise wasn't quite like anything I'd ever heard, and yet I felt this odd fascination to keep listening.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For a while, I avoided returning to the record. I think I gave it a middling score (if memory serves me correctly, a 6/10, which is a sin for which I'm sure I'll atone in whatever hellish afterlife I end up in) and tried to move on with my life. Despite that, though, the album just kept calling out to me, in a way that I hadn't experienced previously (or indeed, with almost any other records since).</p>
            <br>
            <p>So, I tried alternative routes to get into the genre. To cut a long story short, Ride's <em>Nowhere</em> ended up serving as my proper jumping off point, getting me more familiar and accepting of this usage of beautiful, overwhelming guitar noise being overlayed atop otherwise catchy and memorable indie rock tracks. It was only after I owned that record on vinyl, had sworn myself as a Ride devotee, and checked out various other albums from the genre (including Slowdive's <em>Just for a Day</em>, as for some reason at the time I was adamant that I didn't enjoy <em>Souvlaki</em>) that I knew I was ready to hear <em>Loveless</em> again.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Suddenly, everything clicked into place. It was like seeing the album in a whole new light. This thick sea of noise wasn't something to wade through in search of a discernible pop song - it was a beautiful textural adornment, a layer of screaming bliss atop some of the most gorgeous and catchy hits that never were.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The first one to really click was "Sometimes", which feels like a somewhat contradictory statement considering I just put so much stock into the fantastic pop songwriting on the record, with the thick, hypnotic droning guitar on "Sometimes" proving to be one of the less pop-inspired tracks on the record. Despite that, though, this song is one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard in my life. A suffocated, slowly fading acoustic guitar drowns as it fades away beneath a wall of low end fuzz, with Kevin's longing vocals faintly crying out as they glide above it all. The solitary organ in the background serves as the perfect addition to send the song towards truly stratospheric heights, and after its excellent usage in the equally brilliant 'Lost in Translation' any chance of this song escaping my mind was gone. This is my current favourite track on the whole record, but that accolade changes so frequently that trying to give it out to any particular track is a waste of time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>"When You Sleep" is the moment where you really start to realise <em>Loveless</em> is, at its heart, just a fantastic pop record. The mark of a truly fantastic shoegaze song is often one that can be retranslated to acoustic guitar without losing an ounce of their effectiveness, and "When You Sleep" is certainly no exception to this, as hundreds of indie YouTube covers have taught me over the years. It's a distinction shared with another of shoegaze's finest moments, that being "Alison" by Slowdive, despite both songs taking such a radically different approach to the sound of shoegaze. "When You Sleep" is easily the most accessible track on the record, with the sea of noise serving as a somewhat accessible overlay compared to many of the tracks surrounded by it (and trust me, we'll get onto those). It surprises me that, bar a brief stint as a radio-only promo track, this track was never one that Creation attempted to push as a single. Maybe they were just concerned that anyone who listened to it would become so dangerously infatuated with the record that it could cause mass hysteria.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We're going very out of order on this brief track-by-track, but I really ought to touch on the sonic masterpiece that is "To Here Knows When". I don't think there's a single other song on this album (or, indeed, ever) that can replicate the feeling of ascending to the heavens quite like this one can. The droning, snarling guitar line hangs so delicately over the oddly danceable drum beat and the lead synth (?) line, as you're serenaded by Bilinda's vocals into a state of complete and utter bliss. This track, and I mean this with not an ounce of hyperbole, feels like it's a representation of the heat death of the universe. I'm sure that may sound ridiculously pretentious to most, but trust me, if you're as much of a fan of this record as I am, it's not a particularly controversial statement to make.</p>
            <br>
            <p>"Only Shallow" surely has to be one of the single most daring openers to a record ever. The slight drum count in is the only warning and respite you'll get before an onslaught of guitar bends come to wage war on your audio system. The power chords powering the noisy chorus along give the song all the energy it needs, and Bilinda's vocals are at what is arguably their peak, whispering vaguely sexual (?) promises as the tremolo strumming entrances you into a state of complete delirium.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I find the album's closer, "Soon", to be the closest <em>Loveless</em> gets to even vaguely acknowledging the contemporary 90s music scene surrounding it at the time. Backed up by a sampled, instantly catchy baggy style drum loop, the fuzzy guitar that kicks in during the verse is the only real indication that this isn't the next chart hit from the likes of The Stone Roses or Happy Mondays. It ultimately serves as the perfect closer, offering a dance-inspired point of reference for those who wouldn't normally listen to a shoegaze record, all the while continuing to tear their face off with a wave of gorgeously thick guitar layering.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Out of fear of this review being an incomprehensible wall of praise, I'll refrain from overly analysing the other tracks - please don't interpret this as any sort of statement on their quality (indeed, "What You Want" and "Loomer" are two of the most underrated tracks on the entire album, and outside of the off-kilter interlude track that is "Touched" the album doesn't really stray from perfection once throughout its runtime), but rather not wanting to repeat the compliments I've already given.</p>
            <br>
            <p><em>Loveless</em> reportedly almost bankrupted Creation Records (although the reliability of Alan McGee's statements on the matter has been called into question many a time), and the entire process drove many of its staff mad. Yet, every single second that Kevin Shields and co. spent perfecting this utter masterpiece of an album clearly did not go to waste. It serves as a statue in a genre, and it arguably almost killed shoegaze before it could even develop because of the simple fact that nobody could live up to its brilliance. In another timeline, I'm sure there's years of build up in the realm of droning ambient noise that comes to explain "To Here Knows When", or some subset of danceable shoegaze that one can draw comparisons with in the case of "Soon". But this is not that timeline. Kevin Shields was just such a visionary that he essentially laid all the groundwork himself, and left it up to his successors to take what <em>Loveless</em> had done and reinterpret it. Even if <em>Loveless</em> may only be my second favourite album of all time (at time of writing, the noisy emo perfection on <em>After the Night</em> just about pips it to the post), I cannot deny that it is the single most influential and important album within shoegaze as a genre, and anyone who denies such a sentiment needs to stop lying to themselves.</p>
            <br>
            <p><em>Loveless</em> is perfect. It's the most beautiful noise you could ever ask for, in every single quantifiable form.</p>

            <img src = "covers/ayw13m.png" alt="A Year With 13 Moons - Jefre Cantu-Ledesma">
            <p class = "post-meta">Jefre Cantu-Ledesma - A Year With 13 Moons (10/02/2015, Mexican Summer)</p>
            <p class = "post-meta">Review written 22/06/2025.</p>
            <b>8/10</b>
            <p>Over the past few days, I've been going on a short adventure through the back catalogue of Jefre Cantu-Ledesma, for reasons that I find a bit difficult to nail down. I've always had a distinct, emotional fondness for the utterly crushing, noisy, fuzzy warmth of his most acclaimed project, <em>Love Is a Stream</em>, and after a potentially worrying number of replays of that record I decided it might be time to delve a bit further down the rabbit hole.</p>
            <br>
            <p><em>A Year With 13 Moons</em> is a really interesting stop on this adventure. One thing that I've admired through my delving into Cantu-Ledesma's back catalogue is how his projects are often prone to borrowing moods and themes of past records, but will always mix them up and explore said themes in radically different ways, ways that he has not approached before. So, I was very pleased when coming away from this record to find that it provides new takes on the themes and feelings I get from <em>Love Is a Stream</em> (that being an immense sense of warmth, confusion and loss), but in a very different manner.</p>
            <br>
            <p><em>A Year With 13 Moons</em> is flirting with being classified as a noise record for a fair chunk of its runtime. This isn't something that would immediately appeal to me, as someone who's never really been a big fan of pure noise music. However, my general exception to that rule is that I can really love and get into noise when it's used sparingly, alongside other elements to provide a good sense of diversity. <em>A Year With 13 Moons</em> more than delivers on that premise. Through its' runtime, you're met with crushing drones, blissful ambient soundscapes and psychedelic retrofuture sounding hypnagogic pop, all accentuated with the screaming sound of a galaxy starting to collapse.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sure, what an individual might get out of this record is very varied from person to person, and really depends on your willingness to find meaning in the abstract, and to focus on pure texture as opposed to anything else. Despite that, though, <em>A Year With 13 Moons</em> provides a surprising amount of grounded, beat driven moments that serve as something of a reference point for those who might not necessarily check out a record like this. Notable examples that spring to mind are "The Twins/Shadows", "Agate Beach" and my absolute favourite, "Along the Isar", a particularly serene track that almost acts as a rest stop within the sonic battlefield. These feel like the ideas that would build up to the truly jaw-dropping <em>Love's Refrain</em>, one of Cantu-Ledesma's most acclaimed tracks, so it feels a bit odd to see this record go so underappreciated in comparison.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I suppose that might be due to the tracks on here being less developed than <em>Love's Refrain</em>, having less room to breathe and often disintegrating before they really have chance to reach the same mind-numbing heights (with notable exceptions, such as the radical opener "The Last Time I Saw Your Face", which really evokes feelings I hadn't felt since <em>Love Is a Stream</em>, and is a track I'm deeply fond of).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Nonetheless, I think that what is lost in these tracks being given less time to develop is made up for in the stunning sonic diversity on display here. This is truly a great project from Cantu-Ledesma, which doesn't seem to have garnered quite the praise I believe it deserves.</p>

            <p class = "post-meta">The Radio Dept. - Pulling Our Weight EP (19/11/2003, Labrador)</p>
            <p class = "post-meta">Review written 17/06/2025.</p>
            <b>9/10</b>
             <p>This EP really caught me by surprise. I was already somewhat familiar with The Radio Dept. and their work thanks to hearing <em>Lesser Matters</em> during my initial forays into shoegaze as a genre, and had picked up a few other favourite individual tracks by them through the following years (including, notably, <em>I Don't Need Love, I've Got My Band</em>, which makes an appearance on this particular EP).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Despite my familiarity with TRD, however, they had never particularly clicked with me as a band. Outside of the aforementioned <em>I Don't Need Love...</em>, none of their songs felt like they had much emotional connection with me, as much as I admired their indietronica-aligned blending of noisy, droning shoegaze synths with poppy, sometimes even arguably twee guitar lines.</p>
            <br>
            <p>That all changed upon hearing this EP. This is one of the most consistent shoegaze projects I've had the pleasure of hearing in a long, long time. I know that might not be particularly remarkable, given the runtime clocks in at just a little under 19 minutes, but not a single second of said runtime goes to waste.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Every track here is essentially just a particularly remarkable execution of the same great formula: take a sombre, downbeat yet still distinctly warm and approachable indie pop track, and drench it in a sea of beautiful noise. From the rather lo-fi sounding and blown out drums, to the signature jagged synth work which serves as TRD's staple, it all meshes together into a gorgeously lush soundscape, one that perfectly accompanies the vulnerable adolescent lyricism being woven into each individual song.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now, sure, TRD certainly aren't the most experimental when it comes to integrating noise within pop songs. I don't think they'd try and pretend for even a moment that they are, in fact. Despite that, I think the way they do pull it off here is a bit more interesting and fulfilling than many of their noisy indie peers. Maybe that's because of the increased sonic diversity that comes with the focus on electronic elements, I'm not quite sure. It evokes the likes of <em>Sweet Trip</em> and their noisier indietronica cuts, and as a huge fan of that material, this is more than appealing to me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>None of that would be relevant if the underlying songs themselves were uninteresting, though. Thankfully, that is not the case. TRD avoid the trappings of many typical indie pop records and produce works that effortlessly balance vulnerability and melancholia, whilst avoiding sounding too twee or childish. I'm aware just how many times I've referred to it throughout this review, but track 3, <em>I Don't Need Love, I've Got My Band</em>, is undoubtedly my favourite example of this. The way the rather simplistic lyricism weaves a story of self-distractions, only for said self-distractions to be utterly shattered amongst a well of noise in the outro portion, is an idea that's so simple yet effective that I'm surprised I can't name 200 other examples of it being done.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To avoid this entire review essentially being a love letter to one particular track, <em>The City Limit</em> ended up being the other standout here for me. It's definitely the noisiest individual track, and also the most slow-burn and atmospheric material on here. It almost seems to have overtones of Slowdive within the songwriting, feeling particularly like an early version of the opener <em>Slomo</em> from their 2017 comeback record.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Despite only singling out two individual tracks, rest assured that every single song on <em>Pulling Our Weight</em> hovers roughly around the same level of excellence. I cannot recommend this EP enough, and it has more than convinced me to give the rest of TRD's discography the attention I probably should have given it in the first place.</p>

            <img src = "covers/pygmalion.jpg" alt="Pygmalion - Slowdive">
            <p class = "post-meta">Slowdive - Pygmalion (06/02/1995, Creation)</p>
            <p class = "post-meta">Review written 24/04/2025.</p>
            <b>10/10</b>
            <p> Whenever I get the feeling to put on Slowdive‚Äôs Pygmalion, I get this visual of a blank, white, expansive void stretching out in front of me. Maybe I‚Äôm just being influenced by the minimalist cover art, which itself reinterprets 1950s graphic notation to further create the sense of deep unfamiliarity. 

                <br><br>It‚Äôs such a stark contrast to the warmth, the dense and layered nature of Souvlaki. On that album, from the moment the opening chord of ‚ÄúAlison‚Äù bursts into your ears, to the sombre death of the record with ‚ÄúDagger‚Äù, there‚Äôs never a moment where you‚Äôre alone. Even the more minimal tracks like ‚ÄúHere She Comes‚Äù and the dub-influenced ‚ÄúSing‚Äù feel like they‚Äôre always reassuringly close, dipping their toes into the realms of ambient and minimalism but always coming back out to remind you they‚Äôre there. Couple that with gorgeous blasts of warmth, layered guitars and vulnerable, emotional lyricism and vocal performances from Neil and Rachel, and you have an album that always makes you feel at least the slightest bit familiar with your surroundings, as ethereal and dreamy as they may be.
                
                <br><br>Pygmalion drenches itself in the opposite. The opening chord of ‚ÄúRutti‚Äù acts as your first indication that you‚Äôre travelling deep into the unknown. Taking cues from the likes of ‚ÄúMyrrhman‚Äù by Talk Talk off their sublime Laughing Stock, an album that effectively solidified one of the key approaches to post-rock as a genre in the UK in the early 90s (as did its predecessor), you‚Äôre immediately made to contend with this feeling of isolation, sparseness, and of unpredictability.
                
                <br><br>That last one seems particularly strange, considering one of the things Pygmalion is remembered for nowadays is its repetitive structure, which oftentimes draws parallels to the likes of Krautrock whilst pulling (albeit, in a massively transformed manner) bits and pieces from the dance and electronic music of the day. Yet, after that opening chord, the uncertainty as you wait for the next one to be struck feels like a lifetime passing by in all of four seconds. It‚Äôs as if you‚Äôre staring into nothing, a place completely devoid of structure, where the abstract is at the forefront. 
                
                <br><br>Ian McCutcheon‚Äôs rhythmic, almost robotic drumming pushes the track forward, but the guitar stays dancing around in this uncommitted, aimless direction. All the while, Neil‚Äôs vocals are the one constant many would keep pushing on to hear. They stray from anything concrete, remaining as cryptic as you‚Äôd imagine in a situation like this. It‚Äôs taking that philosophy that was pioneered with shoegaze as a genre, of ‚Äòvocals being used as an instrument‚Äô, and pushing it to a new level. The vocals here are your lifebuoy amongst a sea of confusion and nothingness. Cling to them, or sink into the abyss forever. 
                
                <br><br>It all helps to give the words more meaning, cryptic as they may be. ‚ÄúInto the light of mine, inside I‚Äôll fall‚Äù is a line that always permeates through my brain whenever I think of not just ‚ÄúRutti‚Äù, but this album in general. Not because it‚Äôs a lyric that resonates with me on a personal level, or it being some well written quip, or anything like that - but how it fits to introduce you to the world of Pygmalion in the most understated but absolutely memorable fashion possible.
                
                <br><br>I might have made some vague reference to the ‚Äòvocals as an instrument‚Äô phenomenon of shoegaze in the paragraph before the last one, but don‚Äôt get it confused - Pygmalion is, for most of its run, the furthest thing from a shoegaze album possible. An intentional decision, taken at the behest of Neil and Rachel as the shoegazing scene in the UK at the time began to collapse around them, with Alan McGee looking for almost any excuse he could come up with to drop Slowdive from Creation Records‚Äô roster in his constant search for ‚Äòthe next Oasis‚Äô to add to the label in their place. 
                
                <br><br>The context surrounding the record, even if it seems a little unremarkable compared to the atmospheric beauty found within its content, has always been one of the reasons I have a deep, deep respect for Pygmalion. Faced with all the odds stacked against them, staring down the barrel of Britpop and with what seems like everyone wishing for their demise, instead of pivoting to match their contemporaries (eg. Ride, Lush) and pumping out a record that is looked back on as an inessential release in their discography brought on by label pressure, Slowdive decided to double down on their never-ending search to expand their sound. 
                
                <br><br>Maybe this was deliberate, their one final way of showing resilience against what Creation had become before they were kicked off the label, the album deleted, and the band disintegrated. Regardless of the reasoning behind the decision, it‚Äôs part of why they are my favourite band of all time. 
                
                <br><br>After ‚ÄúRutti‚Äù brings itself to a sudden halt after ten minutes of building, we are met with the sole track on the album that seems to pay homage to Slowdive‚Äôs past work. On an album almost completely devoid of walls of guitar, of those washes of sound that defined albums like Just For a Day and Souvlaki, ‚ÄúCrazy For You‚Äù is like one final celebration of shoegazing. It‚Äôs the death of a genre, mapped out as this subtle, slowly building, and spectacularly unchanging track, that jumps right back into its shoegazing roots just around the three minute mark as the sea of guitar many yearn to hear displays itself for one final time.
                
                <br><br>‚ÄúCrazy For You‚Äù might be the single most repetitive song on the album lyrically. In fact, it‚Äôs one of the single most lyrically repetitive songs I‚Äôve ever heard. I mean, it‚Äôs just the words ‚Äòcrazy for loving you‚Äô repeated constantly until the track dies out. Yet, I wouldn‚Äôt take it any other way. Between Neil‚Äôs reverberated, layered vocals and that utterly beautiful, dreamy guitar line that hangs over it all, it‚Äôs a deeply honest statement that feels like it meshes so brilliantly with the sound of the track itself. It‚Äôs the sound of infatuation, played out in all its atmospheric, beautiful, heart-wrenching and never-ending ‚Äòglory‚Äô.
                
                <br><br>Even the little things on this song make it feel like an outlier at this place on the record. The brief remnants of studio chatter that peek through at the start of the track providing a rare glimpse back to the real world. Ian‚Äôs drumming feels more human than it does on a lot of the rest of the record, even if it remains rather unchanging as the track goes. 
                
                <br><br>In fact, many have pointed to the original demo version of this song, which has been available via deluxe reissues and leaks for years now, as the superior version. Arguably, the arrangement presented there might have technically been a greater stylistic fit, with the hypnotic and unchanging drum machine looping in the background matching the philosophy of the record. Yet, there‚Äôs a sparseness the final version of ‚ÄúCrazy For You‚Äù pulls off that the demo version just can‚Äôt match for me, in between those gorgeous swells, the sort of sparseness that reminds you of the void you find yourself in on Pygmalion. Even at the death of the song, you‚Äôre met with an almost two minute outro where there are no yearning vocals to be found. No drumming to remind you of the humanity on display. Just some slowly dying guitar feedback, that again feels symbolic of the death of shoegaze as a genre, and the gorgeous twinkle of a guitar line to slowly entrance you back into Pygmalion‚Äôs ambient soundscapes.
                
                <br><br>‚ÄúMiranda‚Äù is what I find to be the ‚Äòpoint of no return‚Äô for Pygmalion. Many people I‚Äôve asked about this song point to it as one that is more oblique, the moment where the avant-garde tinges this album holds become absolutely impossible to ignore (if they‚Äôd managed to ignore them on ‚ÄúRutti‚Äù, anyway). From the constantly looping short acoustic guitar sequence, to Rachel‚Äôs angelic vocals - a Slowdive mainstay, sure, but I can‚Äôt think I can name another instance where they‚Äôve been given such significance on a track before, maybe even since. ‚ÄúSing‚Äù on Souvlaki is an example that springs to mind, but even that was backed up by a gorgeous dub-inspired instrumental that served as the perfect stage for her vocals to intertwine with.
                
                <br><br>‚ÄúMiranda‚Äù features almost nothing like that, bar the acoustic guitar I mentioned previously and a brief, constantly layered vocal sample. It really highlights how angelic Rachel‚Äôs presence is across this record, somehow even more so than Neil‚Äôs already ethereal and wavering vocals. It drags you away from the structure, the more conventional and familiar sounds of ‚ÄúCrazy For You‚Äù, and pulls you right back into the unknown. It‚Äôs disorienting, psychedelic, and I can‚Äôt imagine the album without it.
                
                <br><br>Going even further down that route, ‚ÄúTrellisaze‚Äù was the song that I, a diehard fan of this album, could never quite appreciate for a good while. This is the track that pushes the disorientating and abstract sounds you‚Äôll find throughout Pygmalion to their absolute limit. Structure on this song is almost a deliberate lie. The odd bits of percussion to be found here are sampled, provide very little to hold on to, and almost feel like they‚Äôre there to deliberately confuse you more than anything else.
                
                <br><br>Between that, the occasional bursts of cymbal crashing and guitar noise, and the quiet yet very notable feedback usage which serves as a mainstay to just top off the album‚Äôs most hypnotic moments, I feel like I can draw comparisons between this and Talk Talk‚Äôs ‚ÄúTaphead‚Äù, also from Laughing Stock. There‚Äôs no accident between these repeated comparisons - Halstead has gone on record to state his love of late era Talk Talk‚Äôs post-rock masterpieces, and it feels like there‚Äôs moments on Pygmalion that take concepts Talk Talk originally would have pioneered (themselves no doubt inspired by Krautrock records of the 70s) and drench them in a subtle, atmospheric sheen. It‚Äôs a formula that, whilst some might criticise for being a tad unoriginal, is one that I always find utterly fascinating. The lineage of the first wave of UK post-rock has always been something that‚Äôs up for a great deal of debate, and it‚Äôs not something this review is really cut out to deal with, but seeing concepts evolving over time through the genre naturally, despite the scene itself being fairly small and only just starting to gain steam at this point in time, is something I feel anyone can look back on and appreciate.
                
                <br><br>A short, ambient interlude, ‚ÄúCello‚Äù, marks the transition back to a slightly more structured beauty. Pulling from another short acoustic guitar section, the chorus of heavenly vocals on ‚ÄúJ‚Äôs Heaven‚Äù mark a slight return to the sounds of ‚ÄúMiranda‚Äù from a couple of tracks ago, as does the presence of a thick bass guitar that gives the song a rare sense of structure. You‚Äôre still in the void at the moment, searching around for something to cling to amongst the hopeless abstract that‚Äôs surrounding you. 
                
                <br><br>Yet, despite that, there‚Äôs a newfound sense of melancholy, something we haven‚Äôt really felt since ‚ÄúRutti‚Äù. Emotion on Pygmalion feels like something of a foreign concept, and it‚Äôs only something the album explores directly when it is confident it can pull it off. For instance, ‚ÄúCrazy For You‚Äù and its‚Äô clear romantic intent, which might speak to how ridiculously simple and overwhelming those feelings can be, for an album as often sparse and cryptic as Pygmalion to be able to pull it off with no sense of holding back.
                
                <br><br>That point almost feels as if it rolls perfectly into ‚ÄúVisions of LA‚Äù. The final ‚Äòinterlude‚Äô track, an acoustic ballad that is little more than what it establishes from the beginning. Rachel‚Äôs vocals are not here for pure atmospheric depth, as reverb-laden as they may be. This track feels like it marks a distinct change, in the back portion of the record. We‚Äôre moving towards something concrete, now. Although it may be short, it may be one that is often ignored by many, ‚ÄúVisions of LA‚Äù is a key point of structure and change within Pygmalion‚Äôs utterly cold and often oblique nothingness. It feels like it calls back to those moments of warmth on ‚ÄúCrazy For You‚Äù. It‚Äôs building to a climax that, deep down, the listener has been waiting for since Rutti‚Äôs first chord was played, at this point about 35 minutes ago.
                
                <br><br>And on the next track, that climax is fulfilled. 
                
                <br><br>I could write words about ‚ÄúBlue Skied an‚Äô Clear‚Äù for hours. I can‚Äôt even be sure if this is my personal favourite song on Pygmalion, but it‚Äôs always the one that I feel has the most place on the album. It‚Äôs the most pivotal, the most critical point on this otherwise lonely, abstract collection of songs. That‚Äôs because it feels human. It feels alive. 
                
                <br><br>The verses still hold up some of the album‚Äôs most isolated, most psychedelic and hypnotic qualities. From Neil‚Äôs background vocals that feel impossible to peg down properly, to the tremolo guitar that dives in and out of the song like it‚Äôs filling in for a church organ. Everything feels slightly off, still - although it‚Äôs more densely packed than what we‚Äôve been hearing since ‚ÄúCrazy For You‚Äù, there‚Äôs still this sense of wariness. The album is still bathing itself in the abstract. It‚Äôs refusing to show its true self, the true emotion that lurks within.
                
                <br><br>And yet, in that chorus, everything breaks.
                
                <br><br>It feels like you‚Äôve emerged into a green, grassy field on a summer‚Äôs day. Neil‚Äôs vocals turn to these gorgeous, emotion filled chants (‚Äúyou say love, and it sounds so good‚Ä¶‚Äù), as an almost angelic section of guitar lines float around your ears. In most cases, it is the percussion on a track that can totally reinterpret how the other elements sound - in this case, I feel like it‚Äôs the other elements that you can find aside from the percussion that change how you view everything else. ‚ÄúBlue Skied an‚Äô Clear‚Äù is a song that is loving, incomprehensibly heart-warming, a rush of blood to the head. 
                
                <br><br>There‚Äôs no wonder that parallels can easily be drawn between this and Talk Talk‚Äôs spiritual masterpiece, ‚ÄúI Believe In You‚Äù. Yet, whereas on that track the emotion was provided via Mark Hollis‚Äô sobering lyricism and pained vocal cries, ‚ÄúBlue Skied‚Ä¶‚Äù elicits the emotion via the contrast it presents with the rest of Pygmalion. It opens up, and finally reveals everything in an utterly climactic moment. 
                
                <br><br>Even if you think it might be ridiculous to call albums things that can be considered ‚Äòalive‚Äô, I feel fairly confident in saying that this track feels like Pygmalion‚Äôs soul being laid bare. It is a moment of utter vulnerability on a work so abstract, cryptic and cold, that the impact of its gorgeous swells cannot physically be overstated. 
                
                <br><br>That might be part of why the closing track, ‚ÄúAll of Us‚Äù, is so heart wrenching. It sounds defeated, after the triumph that was heard on ‚ÄúBlue Skied‚Ä¶‚Äù. Even after a moment of utter beauty, of imagining an escape from the album‚Äôs sparseness and evasive soundscapes, Slowdive‚Äôs position as a band was so untenable, so utterly beyond saving at this time in their career that there was no way those feelings could persist into reality. 
                
                <br><br>‚ÄúAll of Us‚Äù is a eulogy. A eulogy to a band who, at the time, were detested, generally misunderstood, ignored, and never given the chance they deserved to shine. As the closing track in Slowdive‚Äôs discography, this must have been the most heart-wrenching way to possibly close things out. Even despite the later formation of Mojave 3 and Slowdive‚Äôs eventual successful reunion, it‚Äôs almost impossible to look back on Pygmalion and not, for just a moment, be transported back to a band in their dying days.
                
                <br><br>Pygmalion serves as an escape from the real world, to a place often devoid of emotion and of anything to latch onto in the slightest. It‚Äôs for these reasons that the striking humanity it displays, alongside its radical sparseness and embracing of silence, make it undoubtedly my favourite record in Slowdive‚Äôs discography. 
                
                <br><br>Many may consider it imperfect, a poor follow up to the shoegazing bliss demonstrated on their first two records. Things couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.
