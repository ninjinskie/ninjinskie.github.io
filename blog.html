            <p> this is probably quite a short entry. i'm currently sat in my university 
                library overlooking the little duck pond below, procrasting studies by writing in
                my silly little blog. vapour trails this week was co hosted with willow 
                which was extremely fun. not just because willow was a fucking awesome guest,
                and that i love doing vapour trails, but also just because i love getting out 
                of my room. 
                <br><br>
                i'll be on DTMH with willow this weekend, and i can't say i've been more excited for
                something for a long time. i'm very glad to have met willow because it's been extremely 
                awesome to finally have friends to just do whatever with in nottingham (again, getting me
                out of this room)!!! the fact she is absolutely awesome helps a lot, she is extremely cool 
                to talk to and yeah. so cheesed about it.
                <br></br>
                i'm sorry if i'm not being active as of late. university is causing me a lot of studying 
                related guilt, and i'm trying desperately to catch up to that whilst also maintaining 
                at least a little bit of my sanity. 
                <br></br>
                anyway, back to doing my stupid little lab tasks and understanding nothing. bye!!

            <p>i'm not sure how frequently this thing will get updated. or indeed if it
                will ever get updated. the truth is that i've never really bothered with 
                a public blog until this point. most of what i have to say i just post on 
                bsky, and most of what i feel like saying but can't bring myself to ends up 
                in some random, shitty google doc that i've been updating for a good few months 
                now.
                <br><br>
                still, it kinda feels nice to be able to type random stuff into a sort of void 
                where i know most people probably won't read it. if you are reading this, then
                it means you actively clicked on me posting about it, which means you give at
                least something of a shit about how i am and what i'm planning on yapping about.
                thanks, i appreciate it. :)
                <br><br>
                i've been dealing with some very strong bouts of loneliness and depression over the 
                last year or so, potentially a bit longer than that. i know that might technically 
                be too deep of a topic to dive into on a public blog (it probably is), let alone
                the first entry, but it contextualises a lot of other stuff i feel like talking about 
                so it's semi-essential info to know.
                <br><br>
                a number one piece of advice i can give is to never, ever live at home while you're
                at university. i did it during my first year and hated it, which then somehow led 
                me to conclude that "oh i'll be fine, i don't need to stress too much about moving for year two", which
                is possibly the worst thing you could ever think. i'm living around 25 miles from where i actually 
                attend university and it basically feels like i'm completely isolated from anything cool going off there.
                shit, i might as well be isolated from my own studies at this rate. i'm not keeping on top of things in 
                the slightest. 
                <br><br>
                fortunately, i've been trying my best over the last couple of weeks to be more active around campus. 
                i've met up with a very lovely friend from bluesky (hi willow!!!!) and it was such a fun day, it really did
                wonders for my mental health. i've also been hosting my own show, vapour trails, which if you're reading 
                this you're probably aware of given how much i spam it everywhere. i'll be running a crossover episode with 
                another radio show this week, more details to come....it's gonna be so cool you don't even know!!
                <br><br>
                although i'm getting a place next year and finally, 100% moving out, it doesn't mean THIS year will be any 
                easier. everything up to now has kind of been incredibly draining and disheartening, and i'm now basically 
                just a hermit at this point jumping at any opportunity to get out of this stupid room where i basically do 
                everything. in fact, that's a big part of what my album is going to be about.
                <br><br>
                oh yeah, the album. it's the debut album i'm releasing under the name "sweethoney". there's a couple of singles
                out for it, although one of them (fatigue) is a very early song that has since been scrapped. at this moment in 
                time, the main tracklist is basically done and i'm just doing whatever i can to try and make myself not hate what 
                i've made. it's sort of a losing battle, because i think everything on it is quite shit, except potentially the 
                outro of one song that i won't spoil yet.
                <br><br>
                the album is about quite a lot of stuff. isolation, guilt, uni anxiety, love, friends, procrastination.
                some of the stuff i mentioned i do sing about, very badly, with terrible words and a fucking obnoxious singing voice.
                there's quite a lot of genres, mainly down to the fact i have no idea what the fuck i'm doing. there's some ambient,
                some shoegaze, some slowcore/singer songwriter acoustic stuff, and 99% of it is (as mentioned previously) extremely
                bad.
                <br><br>
                regardless of that fact, i'll still be putting it out anyway. this album has given me a reason to procrastinate my uni 
                work for the last two weeks and it's one i won't be able to move past in the slightest, and i frankly don't see myself 
                being able to polish this thing up any further. you can't polish a turd after all. i have a super important test worth 
                about 30% of one of my module grades friday next week and i literally have no idea what i'm doing. hopefully the album 
                will drop at some point either this weekend or next week. there's just a quick sample i've got to get, some mixing changes
                and that's about it. i'll post a link to it on my bsky whenever i release it (and of course you can find it via the links on the home page).
                <br><br>
                anyway, that's a condensed and somewhat filtered version of the words i'd want to say at this minute in time. i hope some of you 
                might be able to miraculously extract some ounce of joy from one of the songs when this piece of shit record releases. in the mean time,
                i'll be trying (and failing) to study for my friday test, and make sure you tune in to vapour trails this week. we've got a fantastic show lined up.
                <br><br>
                take good care of yourself
                <br><br>
